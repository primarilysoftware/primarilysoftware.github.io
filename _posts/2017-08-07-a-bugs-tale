Value objects are a good thing.  I find myself using them more and more to harden the code I write, moving away from Primitive Obsession.  The value of Value Objects has already been covered quite thoroughly by much more [credible](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2007/12/03/dealing-with-primitive-obsession/) [sources](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/05/25/DesignSmellPrimitiveObsession/) [than myself](http://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/2015/03/07/functional-c-primitive-obsession/), so I do not feel the need to expand on why you may want to use them.
