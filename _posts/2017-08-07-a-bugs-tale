Working in a production support role can take you on some wild rides.  At times, hunting down the source of a bug can make
you want to rip out your hair, and even question your sanity.  Quite often though, the harder you work to
unravel a problem, the sweeter the satisfaction when you finally get to the bottom of it.  This is the story of one of those
kind of bugs.  While it may have cost me a few hair folicles, the payoff at the end was worth it. 

### How it all started
I work for a fairly small software development shop.  We support a handful of different products, including
a desktop app that uses WCF to call back home to one of our services.  Out of the blue, we got a report from a user
saying they were getting timeout errors in the desktop software related to some functions that called back to 
our WCF service.  Initially, our support team thought this must be a fluke.  If our service was down, we would have
been flooded with calls.  This was just a single desktop, in an office with several installations.  Being desktop
software, support frequently gets calls from users blaming our software for any and every PC related problem they 
may have.  We hadn't released any updates to this part of the app for months, so support felt pretty confident that
this was not really our problem.
