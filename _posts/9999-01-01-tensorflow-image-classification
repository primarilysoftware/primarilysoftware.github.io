My dad has a house on a lake.  One of the first things he did after purchasing the house was rebuild
the shore line.  What had been a wall of decaying wood and gravel, was transformed into a beautiful
stone boardwalk, culminating with a set of stone steps that descended gently into the water.  It 
looked great, and just as importantly, created an amazing space for he, his children, and his
grandchildren to spend time together.

He soon discovered a problem though.  These same stone steps that made the lake so inviting to his family,
also invited some unwanted guests, canadian geese.  I have grown to despise these creatures.  I live
in an area where in the summer, they seemingly take over every pond, lake, and sometimes even, parking
lot, honking at and charging anyone who dares approach.  Whats more, even when they take leave
from a particular area, they leave behind trails of crap.  Literally, crap.  Nearly every morning, my
dad would come down to the shore to see his lovely stone boardwalk defaced with the entrails of these
nastly creatures.

He was determined to do something about it.  His first attempt was a goose fence.
This worked fairly well, but was unsightly, and a nuissance when it came to taking care of the yard.
He ended up taking it down, hoping it had served its purpose.  It was only a few days before these
geese came back.

My brother and law and I are "computer guys", and jokingly discussed alternative solutions.  We arrived
at the idea of an automated water gun.  We both could imagine a system where a camera could monitor
the area, leveraging some of the recent advancements in image classification to identify when geese
came near, triggering a water gun to fire at the geese, hopefully scaring them away.  It was a fun
idea, that started as mostly a joke.  I kept thinking about it though, and started to wonder how
difficult it would be to really pull this off?

With any sufficiently challenging problem, you have to break it down into managable pieces.  While
I do not know if I will ever complete the vision of an automated goose water gun, I thought it would
be a great learning oppurtunity to see if I could break off one of the pieces, identifying geese
within images from a camera feed.  Not a day goes by without me seeing some new article about how
machine learning and neural nets were used in some cool new way.  While I have studied the subject
a little, I have never tried to apply these ideas to a real problem.  I felt like this goose
recognition problem would be a nice gateway for me into that space, so I set off on this journey.

### TensorFlow
When I think of machine learning, the first thing that comes to mind is Google.  They seem to be at
the forefront of this space, applying machine learning techniques to solve real world problems.  I
had read about TensorFlow in the past.  Their website describes it as follows:

> TensorFlowâ„¢ is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs.

That sounds cool, if not a bit abstract.  As I explored the various libraries out there in this space,
what really sold me on TensorFlow was the excellent documentation.  In fact, their docs describe a
technique for [classifying flowers](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_retraining)
that looked like a template for the goose classification problem I was trying to solve.

This looked to be as good a library as any to get started with, so I decided to give it a try.  I
set out to reproduce the flowers example, before adapting it for my goose problem.

### Setting up my environment
I began by setting up my environment to work with TensorFlow.  Again, the docs were great in this
respect.  I am working on a Windows laptop, so I followed the instructions for
[Installing with Anaconda](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows).  Anaconda was
new to me, but what a cool idea!  From what I have gathered, it provides a sort of virtualization
layer, allowing you to setup multiple environments on one machine for working on data science
problems.  It feels almost like a Docker for Data.  I downloaded and installedAnaconda from
[here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).  I then launched the `Anaconda Prompt`, and ran a few
commands to setup my environment:

```
conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5
...
activate tensorflow
...
pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-1.2.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
```

> Note that I installed the CPU version for TensorFlow, since my laptop does not have an NVIDIA GPU.
> If you do have an NVIDIA GPU, TensorFlow can leverage the CUDA platform to get improved performance.
> The GPU version can be installed with this command
> `pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-1.2.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl`

After everything was setup, I launched python from within my tensorflow enironment in Anaconda, and
ran the follwing:

```python
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
>>> sess = tf.Session()
>>> print(sess.run(hello))
```

While the `tf.Session()` command generated a bunch of warnings about SSE, AVX, and FMA instructions
being available, but not targeted in my TensorFlow build, everything did appear to work just fine.

### Flower Classification
With my environment setup, I was ready to start working through the Flower Classification example.  The
example was apparently written for a linux audience, so I had do deviate in a few places.  I started
off by creating a clean working directory for this experiment.  Mine is called `flowers`.  First off,
the example instructs you to download the set of flower photos:

```
curl -O http://download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz
```

If you are running on Windows like me, you probably do not have `curl`.  Anaconda really starts to
shine here.  You are able to install all sorts of packages from Anaconda into your environment.  To
install `curl` into my `tensorflow` environment, I ran the following:

```
conda install --name tensorflow curl
```

Now I could run the curl command to download the set of flower images into my working directory.

> Note the image set is ~218MB, so this could take a while depending on your internet connection.

Ok, I have the images now, but they are in a gzip'ed tarball.  To extract the images on Windows,
I used [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html), though there are a variety of alternatives.  Use
whatever makes you happy :).  After extracting the flower images, I now have a sub-directory in my
`flowers` working directory, `flower_photos`.

At this point, the example on the TensorFlow website started to break down for me.  It was telling me
to run some `bazel build` commands that just didn't seem right.  I started following along with
another example,
[TensorFlow For Poets](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#4).
I picked up with this example at the part where it instructed you to download the
[retrain.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/r1.1/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py)
file.  I downloaded this file and saved it to my 'flowers' working directory.

```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/r1.1/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py > retrain.py
```

Next, I ran the following command to kick off the training process:

```
python retrain.py --bottleneck_dir=bottlenecks --how_many_training_steps=500 --model_dir=inception --summaries_dir=training_summaries\basic --output_graph=retrained_graph.pb --output_labels=retrained_labels.txt --image_dir=flower_photos
```

The `retrain` script is going to do several things for us.  The first time you run it, it will generate
"bottleneck" files for each image in the image set.  This is a performance optimization.  Since the
lower layers of the network are not being retrained, this process is caching the output of that
part of the network.

After all the "bottleneck" files have been generated, training of the final layer of the network will
begin.  While the training is happening, you can view a neat visualization of it's progress using
`TensorBoard`.  To start `TensorBoard`, open another `Anaconda Prompt` and run the following commands
to jump into your tensorflow environment and start `tensorboard`:

```
activate tensorflow
tensorboard --logdir training_summaries &
```

This should spin up a website that you can browse to at [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/).
Watching the evolution of the model unfold is pretty neat.  A couple of things to pay attention to.
The `--summaries_dir` parameter used when retraining the model affects how the data for that run
shows up in TensorBoard.  Note that in the command we executed above, I used `training_summaries\basic` for
this parameter.  Looking at TensorBoard, in the _Runs_ section, you should see runs for `basic\train`
and `basic\validation`.  Also note that when starting TensorBoard, I passed `--logdir training_summaries`.
This is how TensorBoard knows where to find the training logs.  When experimenting, you may want
to attempt multiple runs at training your model, changing various parameters between runs to see
what works best.  When doing this, you would want to tweak the `--summaries_dir` parameter
accordingly between runs.  For instance for a second run, you may want to use something like
`training_summaries\basic_v2` for your `--summaries_dir`.  Once the retrain starts, you would then see `basic_v2\train` and
`basic_v2\validation` entries in the _Runs_ section of TensorBoard.

With my model trained, I was ready to test it out.  The TensorFlow For Poets tutorial provides a
python script for testing the model.  Run the following to save this script to your working
directory:

```
curl -L https://goo.gl/3lTKZs > label_image.py
```

Now use this script on an image to see how the model performs:

```
python label_image.py flower_photos/daisy/21652746_cc379e0eea_m.jpg
```

My model produced the following result:

```
daisy (score = 0.99754)
sunflowers (score = 0.00173)
dandelion (score = 0.00057)
tulips (score = 0.00012)
roses (score = 0.00004)
```

Awesome!  I tried it on some random images I found as well.

![daisy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/primarilysoftware/primarilysoftware.github.io/master/downloads/tensorflow-image-classification/daisy.jpg)

```
daisy (score = 0.98233)
dandelion (score = 0.00949)
tulips (score = 0.00411)
sunflowers (score = 0.00399)
roses (score = 0.00008)
```

That was pretty easy though, what if I try to trick the model?

![lilly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/primarilysoftware/primarilysoftware.github.io/master/downloads/tensorflow-image-classification/lilly.jpg)

```
tulips (score = 0.78723)
roses (score = 0.19735)
sunflowers (score = 0.01342)
daisy (score = 0.00168)
dandelion (score = 0.00033)
```

So this model thinks that a lilly looks a lot like a tulip.  It feels weird to write this, but I think
I can see a similarity there.

### Goose Classification
So I was able to get a sample image classifier working in TensorFlow, now I want to try and adapt this sample to my own
problem, identifying geese in images.  In order to train the model, I was going to need some training images.  In my case, 
I was only going to have 2 classes, goose and not-goose.  So I needed a way to download a bunch of images for each of these
classes.
