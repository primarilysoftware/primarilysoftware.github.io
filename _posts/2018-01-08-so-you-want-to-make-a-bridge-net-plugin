The world of modern web development is ever changing.  As web apps continue to grow in scope and
complexity, developers are continually searching for more powerful tools to help tame that
complexity into something comprehensible and maintainable.  Over the past several years, one of
the pillars of modern web development has consistently been under attack, Javascript.

There has been a long history of projects attempting to fix and even replace Javascript.  From
CoffeeScript, to TypeScript, to Dart and Go, many players have entered this space, some carving
out a niche, but none supplanting the king.

A relatively new contender in this space (at least new to me) is a project called
[Bridge.NET](https://bridge.net/).  Bridge promises to offer all the power of C#, compiled (transpiled?)
to Javascript that can run in the browser.  At work, we are currently in the process of retiring
a Silverlight app that is on life support, so Bridge.NET was a very intriguing option for us.  The
idea that we could port over chunks of our existing view models with minimal changes was too
tempting to pass up.

We decided to give Bridge a go, and after being impressed initially by some
proof of concepts, we found ourselves tugging at some of the seams between the C# world Bridge
has constructed and the Javascript world lurking underneath.

The [getting started docs](https://github.com/bridgedotnet/Bridge/wiki) for Bridge are not a bad
start, but they leave a lot to be desired when you start really digging in.  We found ourselves in
a situation where we needed to tweak some of the output from the Bridge compiler to help with
integrating some non-Bridge code.  Trolling through the Bridge forums, I stumbled across
[a post](https://forums.bridge.net/forum/general/extensions-and-plugins/998-documentation-of-how-to-make-a-plugin)
that suggested that it was possible to write plugins for Bridge to do the kind of thing we needed,
but for the life of me, I could find no information on how to do it.

I was determined though, and stubborn.  After a fair amount of time trudging through decompliled DLLs and source
code, I was finally able to get something working.  So without further ado, I will share my findings in the
hope that someone else may find it userful.

If you have made it this far, I assume you already have a Bridge project setup, so I will skip those details.  You
will want to add a new class library to your solution.

As far as I can tell, there isn't a Nuget package, or anything of the sort designed for building Bridge plugins.
Instead, we will do something a little dirty.  We need to reference the Bridge.Contract.dll.  You can
find it included in one of the packages that was installed for your Bridge application project.  So for your
plugin project, click add reference, and browse to the `packages\Bridge.Min.16.7.0\tools` folder for your solution.
Add `Bridge.Contract.dll` and while you are at it, go ahead and add `ICSharpCode.NRefactory.dll`.

Now we can start working on our plugin.  Add
