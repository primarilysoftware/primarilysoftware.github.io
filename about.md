Hi, my name is Jon Guy.

I have been working as a software developer since 2010, focused mainly in .NET. I am always trying to learn new things, and working to become a better developer.

Some of the things you may find me writing about are Search/Indexing, Machine Learning, DDD, C#, F#, .NET, Functional Programming, and more.
